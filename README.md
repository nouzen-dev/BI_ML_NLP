# The repository:

It contains my personal projects in preparation for my Masters studies & to further my development in Data Science.

My motivation is to move forward with more learning & re-learning in my Data Science journey, & hope to have an opportunity to meet new people & experiences on the journey of growth & self-expansion:
- Mini projects are small projects I learnt from classes in my undertaking of self-learning.
- Bigger projects are aspired by Kaggle competitions & projects. Their directories are prefixed with a number & each project will have its own README file for details.
- Dashboards are for personal refreshments.

It will be expanded with more future personal projects.

Besides improving my Python skills during the process, I also learn to employ various Python libraries & techniques used in BI, ML & NLP, and continued to be inspired by many extraordinary notions and projects. Thank you for all the feedback & suggestion.
