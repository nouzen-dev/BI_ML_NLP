# About this project:

This project examined a music text dataset to classify songs based on 15 unique genres based on attributes such as danceability, energy,
key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness etc.: 

- My motivation was the application of classification models, hyperparameter tweaking & unsupervised learning.
- The output compared models with & without PCA & hyperparameter tweaking to find the best variant for the task. 
- I got to apply correlation matrix, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), cross-validation to compare different models (decision tree, logistic
regression, KNN & Random Forest), RandomSearchCV & KMeans clustering.
- A challenge I faced was & is hyperparameter tweaking. The modelsâ€™ performance after tweaking did not increase as intended and I do not have
enough computational resource for further model optimization. 

A future improvement is to perform deeper analysis of hyperparameters & use GridSearch on ensemble model including Random Forest.
