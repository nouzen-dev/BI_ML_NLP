# About the project:

This is my 1st project after all the mini projects. It analyzed the trend of decreased movie durations in a Netflix dataset, and built a recommender. 

- My motivation was to learn to build a content-based recommender based on an input movie. 
- Specifically, the outputs are 1-hour movies, a point of interest in this project to capitalize on the shortening movie durations from year 1940 to 2020, 
and for a quick movie during lunchtime or dinner. 
- I got to apply NLP techniques I learned (N-gram, TFIDF, cosine similarity etc.). 
- A challenge I faced was the ideation of the recommender - while researching, I was impressed with sophisticated solutions but I decided to devise a simpler one basically using list & indexing. 

While it serves the purpose, the simple recommender can definitely be further improved & expanded to cater to a more customized & better user experience. 
For example, perhaps a collaborative filtering/ user-interaction based one that considers a userâ€™s preference, age group, etc., can be considered for a more 
customized user experience.
